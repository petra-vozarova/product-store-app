# Product Store React App

This is a simple React Application that displays a list of products to the user with some basic information. 

Users can navigate through the list by clicking on buttons with page numbers at the bottom of the page. Each page shows up to ten products. By clicking on each product's picture or title, user can see more information about the product and browse through product's pictures.

`DummyJSON Rest Api` is utilised to fetch products data and to dynamicaly populate our app.
